"""
In async we run ONE BLOCK of code at a time but we cycle which block of code is running. Your program needs to be built 
around async though you can call normal (synchronous) functions from async program.
A - Add async keyword in front of your function declarations to make them awaitable.
B - Add await keyword when you call your async functions (without it they wonâ€™t run).
C - Create tasks from the async functions you wish to start asynchronously. Also wait for their finish.
D - Call asyncio.run to start the asynchronous section of your program.
